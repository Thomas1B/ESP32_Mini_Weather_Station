# ESP32 Mini Weather Station with BME280

  Mini Weather Station using ESP32C3 dev kit 2 and a BME280 Sensor.

  This program was originally written using a esp32 C3 dev kit 2 so pins may be different.
  It collects temperature, humidity, and pressure then uploads its reading to ThingSpeak for remote viewing.
